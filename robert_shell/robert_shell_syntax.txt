Hello, this will explain the syntax and logic behind the Robert Shell Version: 0.0.1


This shell is based on the BASH, but it is written in Rust, has a few modifications, and it is very simplistic in its nature.


Commands so far I would like to implement in the Robert Shell:

cd

ls

grep

cat

** find a way to do git

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Symbols, operands, and ideas:

| -> pipes output of a command into the input of the next command

|| -> seperates two commands one will execute first and then the other

*** IMPORTANT -> implement P E M D A S ***

x + y -> returns the sum of x + y   **find way to return and handle different types of integers

x - y -> returns the difference of x - y   **find way to return and handle different types of integers

x * y -> returns the product of x * y   **find way to return and handle different types of integers

x / y -> returns the quotient of x / y   **find way to return and handle different types of integers

x**y -> returns the x raised to the power of y **find way to return and handle different types of integers

x % y -> returns the x modulos y **find way to return and handle different types of integers

** might be hard but try to make environmental variables

ctrl + l

tab autocomplete

make a unique command, be creative
